            <p>I have an idea for a web site. It will be a site for youth to learn about finances.
            There will be a place for them to learn about checks and balances, reading a balance sheet, write out a check,
                how to open a savings account and the use of credit cards, the good and bad.</p>
            <span>There will be graphics, and games to play to test their knowledge. When they score high points they can
            open an account and receive a debt card to use depending on how much they have in their savings account.</span>
