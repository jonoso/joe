    <h1>The Life and Adventures of Joseph N. Sousa</h1>

        <p>I entered this world not knowing what I was getting myself into. I started by coming out the wrong way but it
        was my way. It was difficult for the doctor and my Mom but it was how I wanted to do it. As I grew I was
            adventureous and very courious but careful in what I did. Growing up in Hayward, California it was a growing
        town and I grew up with it. I watched it changed from fruit orchards to movie theaters, malls and stripe malls.
        It was great to wake up early in the morning, just as the sun was coming up over the Hayward hills, to see it glissing
        off the windows of the skyscrapers across the bay in San Francisco. I lived across the street from the Hayward
        Airport. There was always a view of the city from my roof top.</p>
